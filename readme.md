# Decision Support System - Feature Selection for Customer Churn

An ensemble of two Multi-Objecive Optimisation Algorithms for Machine Learning feature selection. Only for binary classification data-sets. Instructions for running the algorithm are given below.

## Dependencies

Use pip to install all requirements. 

```bash
conda env create -f requirements.yml
```

## Usage

To run the application use the following script:

```bash
streamlit run "/path/front_end.py"
```

## Data

For users that do not have access to their own binary classification data, a set is provided in the folder 'data'. This set is sourced from the IBM Telco Churn data set found here: https://community.ibm.com/community/user/businessanalytics/blogs/steven-macko/2019/07/11/telco-customer-churn-1113
